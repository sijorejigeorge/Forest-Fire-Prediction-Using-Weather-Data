# Project Overview
This project focuses on the prediction of forest fires and the estimation of burned areas using data mining and machine learning techniques. 
The study utilizes meteorological data from the northeast region of Portugal to develop predictive models capable of forecasting forest fire occurrences and assessing their severity.  

Key Objectives
- Predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires.
- Identify key environmental factors influencing forest fire events.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics.
- Explore the potential of machine learning in proactive fire management strategies.

Tools and Libraries used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Google Colab
  
 Visualizations:
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Heatmaps for feature correlation
- Line plots comparing actual vs predicted burned area
- Histograms and summary stats of categorical data (days, months)
